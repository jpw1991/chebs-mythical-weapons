# Cheb's Mythical Weapons

Cheb's Mythical Weapons adds powerful weapons, eg. Excalibur & the Bow of Apollo, to Valheim. The weapons are found in special locations; eg. Excalibur must be found somewhere in the world and only someone with 100 sword skill can remove it from the stone and use it.

Formerly called Cheb's Sword in the Stone, the mod has been renamed, at the request of the commissioner, due of the addition of the Bow of Apollo and upcoming other mythical weapons.

This mod was commissioned by Discord user Mintymintos. If you would like me to create a mod for you, please get in touch.

### Config

**Attention:** To edit the config, the [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) is the most user friendly way. This is a separate mod. Please download and install it.

Press **F1** to open the mod's configuration panel.

You can also edit the configs manually. Almost everything can be tweaked to your liking. For a complete list of all configuration options, please look [here](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-mythical-weapons/wiki/Configs).

### Known Issues

- Quantity doesn't seem to be exact, rather approximate. This will hopefully be locked down and fixed in time.
- If you use [CLLC](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/CreatureLevelAndLootControl/), the minotaur might drop a bazillion axes. Check your CLLC configuration to stop it from changing the minotaur's drops. Its drop is set to be one, and only one, axe.
