# Cheb's Sword in the Stone

Cheb's Sword in the Stone adds a powerful one-handed sword called Excalibur to Valheim. This sword must be found somewhere in the world and only someone with 100 sword skill can remove it from the stone and use it.

Detailed info in the [wiki](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-sword-in-the-stone/wiki). Here's the short version:

- Adds a powerful sword called Excalibur to the game. Excalibur:
	- Cannot be crafted.
	- Suffers no durability loss.
	- Deals 100 slashing damage and 50 spirit damage.
- The sword must be found and taken from the stone. It requires 100 sword skill to remove the sword from the stone.

### Config

**Attention:** To edit the config, the [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) is the most user friendly way. This is a separate mod. Please download and install it.

Press **F1** to open the mod's configuration panel.

You can also edit the configs manually. Almost everything can be tweaked to your liking. For a complete list of all configuration options, please look [here](https://github.com/jpw1991/chebs-sword-in-the-stone/wiki/Configs).

### Known Issues

- Quantity doesn't seem to be exact, rather approximate. This will hopefully be locked down and fixed in time.
